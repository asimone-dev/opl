# Templates

This directory contains reusable templates for required project documentation used throughout the course.

These files serve as starting points for project documentation and are copied into individual project directories as needed. Files in this directory are not submitted directly to Canvas.

Templates include materials for weekly progress submissions and final project documentation such as activity logs, technical manuals, surveys, and reflections.
